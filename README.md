# EMS
The Automated Energy Monitoring System (AEMS) is a cutting-edge solution for reducing energy costs and promoting energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry. The system is designed to provide real-time information about energy usage and generating tariffs for residential and industrial consumers. The objective of AEMS is to raise awareness about daily energy consumption and promote energy conservation.

AEMS features a user-friendly, real-time energy dashboard that provides insights into energy consumption patterns and allows for remote control of each device. The system is based on advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, including data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Chart Studio. The use of these techniques enables the creation of a predictive model to estimate future energy consumption.

The project involves several stages, including data exploration and preprocessing, feature engineering, and the creation of a predictive model. The data is processed to remove any unnecessary columns and fill any missing values, while feature engineering involves creating new columns based on existing data. The predictive model is built using supervised learning, and the resulting device is expected to bring about positive changes in energy usage patterns and provide effective solutions for energy management problems.

In the predictive model, the energy consumption of each device is represented as a function of time, denoted by E(t). The function E(t) can be modeled using a linear regression model or a more advanced model such as a neural network. The optimization of the model parameters can be performed using gradient descent or a similar optimization algorithm. The prediction error can be measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) formula, which is defined as:

MSE = 1/n * Î£(E(t) - E'(t))^2

where n is the number of data points, E(t) is the actual energy consumption, and E'(t) is the predicted energy consumption. The goal is to minimize the MSE and obtain an accurate prediction of future energy consumption.

In conclusion, the Automated Energy Monitoring System (AEMS) offers a comprehensive and innovative solution for reducing energy costs and promoting energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry. The system's real-time energy dashboard and predictive model provide valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and offer the potential for significant energy savings. AEMS is a highly valuable tool for households and industries alike, and its impact on the energy sector is expected to be substantial.
