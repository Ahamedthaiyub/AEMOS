# AEMOS
The Automated Energy Monitoring System (AEM0S) uses machine learning algorithms to model and predict energy consumption patterns. The main goal of the system is to minimize energy consumption and promote energy efficiency by providing real-time information and insights into energy usage. The machine learning algorithms used in AEMS can be either supervised or unsupervised learning.

In supervised learning, the system is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data (energy consumption) is paired with the target data (energy usage patterns). A common example of a supervised learning algorithm used in energy monitoring systems is a regression algorithm, such as linear regression or support vector regression (SVR). The regression model can be represented mathematically as:

.
E(t) = β0 + β1 * t + β2 * d + β3 * w + β4 * h + β5 * m + ... + βp * Xp

where E(t) is the energy consumption at time t, β0, β1, β2, ..., βp are the coefficients of the regression model, t is the time, d is the day of the week, w is the week of the year, h is the hour of the day, m is the month of the year, and Xp represents other features that may affect energy consumption.

In unsupervised learning, the system is trained on an unlabeled dataset and aims to find patterns or structures in the data. A common example of an unsupervised learning algorithm used in energy monitoring systems is clustering, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering. The clustering algorithm groups similar energy consumption patterns together and provides insights into energy usage.


In the predictive model, the energy consumption of each device is represented as a function of time, denoted by E(t). The function E(t) can be modeled using a linear regression model or a more advanced model such as a neural network. The optimization of the model parameters can be performed using gradient descent or a similar optimization algorithm. The prediction error can be measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) formula, which is defined as:

MSE = 1/n * Σ(E(t) - E'(t))^2

where n is the number of data points, E(t) is the actual energy consumption, and E'(t) is the predicted energy consumption. The goal is to minimize the MSE and obtain an accurate prediction of future energy consumption.





In both supervised and unsupervised learning, the prediction error can be measured using a performance metric, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and to optimize its parameters.

In conclusion, the Automated Energy Monitoring System (AEMS) uses advanced machine learning algorithms to model and predict energy consumption patterns.
